# y13 Project - Organiser

### Made in React, with Bootstrap for styling and a VERY small amount of Tailwind
### It is currently hosted at [https://y13project-9c2a6.firebaseapp.com](https://y13project-9c2a6.firebaseapp.com)



## Available Scripts

To start the program, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits, but sometimes needs to be refreshed to reinitialise states.\


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
### **Firebase deploy does not use this folder automatically when deploying, remember to change it when asked. Also, remember to set it up as a single page app.**
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
This is done before deploying to firebase only.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
The app is ready to be deployed!
